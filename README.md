# ChoreHive

## Project setup
Open up a cmd terminal inside the project directory and run the following command to install all necessary dependencies for the project
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and service backend
In the same terminal, start the server for the backend portion of the website. This is necessary for the frontend to make appropriate API calls to db.json
```
npm run build
```

### Compile and service frontend
In a seperate terminal, start the server for the frontend portion of the website. You will be able to access it at http://localhost:8080/
```
npm run serve
```

### Instructions for setting up a profile
Once both local servers have been started, you should be able to see the project's landing screen, which will be empty since you have not joined a house yet.
To do so, sign up for a new profile by clicking the person icon located in the upper right hand corner. From there you will be asked to fill out your information and create a house.  
  
To see an example of a full household, use "4" as a house ID when signing up.
After you have signed in, you will be able to add/view tasks, and makeup tasks, and swap with the other users
